# MachineLearning-Udacity-Final-Project on Breast Cancer Prediction using Supervised techniques

Given breast cancer results from breast fine needle aspiration (FNA) test 
(is a quick and simple procedure to perform, which removes some fluid or cells 
from a breast lesion or cyst (a lump, sore or swelling) with a fine needle 
similar to a blood sample needle). Since this build a model that can classify a 
breast cancer tumor using two training classification:
1= Malignant (Cancerous) - Present

0= Benign (Not Cancerous) -Absent

After loading the dataset, I have used various functions to get familiar with the data and visualized it
using some tools in python(matplotlib,pandas,seaborn). After getting a good idea on the data distribution of each attribute and checking null values and
correlation betweeen attributes next step is data pre processing. I've changed my target class to integer values (0 and 1) and standardised
values in the dataset. I have also used PCA for dimentionality reduction. Lastly I've compared various supervised learning models using different metrics. Analyzed their
performances using box-plots.
